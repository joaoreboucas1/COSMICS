`COSMICS` is one of the first Einstein-Boltzmann codes, written by Edmund Bertschinger and Paul Bode. It implements the Einstein-Boltzmann system of linear equations described in the seminal paper [Cosmological Perturbation Equations in the Synchronous and Conformal Newtonian Gauges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9506072). The documentation can be found at [this Arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9506070). However, the website that used to host this code is now offline. The code can still be found at [Ed Bertschinger's website](https://web.mit.edu/edbert/). I decided to put the code in Github for historical reference.
